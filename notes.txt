Step 1: Collect dataset from flickr with tags "yellowstone" and "landscape" OR use image-net dataset

Step 2: Image segmentation - using SLIC superpixel algorithm (use skimage)

Step 3: Image representation and training - Instead of predicting color pixel-by-pixel,
		we predict two real values (U and V channels) for each segment of the image. 
		This allows us to color segments based on image structures.
		For our model, we train two separate SVRs - one for each
		output channel. To extract feature vectors for each of the
		image segments, we take the square of 10X10 pixels around
		each centroid. We then perform a 2D Fast Fourier Transform
		(FFT) on these squares, giving us our feature vectors fi(x(i)).
		For both regressions, the feature vectors fi(x(i)) are used as
		the input, while the average U and V values of the segment
		x(i) are used as the output.
